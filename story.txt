Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on piano, I thought I would walk about
a little and see the interesting part of the cello. It is a way I have of driving off the
cliff and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the future;
whenever it is a brisk cold November in my head; whenever I find myself involuntarily
sleeping before coffin bed, and bringing up the rear of every car I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately **falling** into the abyss, and methodically
ripping people's object off—then, I account it high time to get to school as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all existed in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the sunset with me. 
Now I'll edit a file on the web, which I will **avoid** doing in the future.
I have now accessed this file on my Mac, where I am **adding a sentence** per a request I received.
